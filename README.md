# ArqBackups_TransferRateControl_Applescript
Applescripts for adjusting the upload rate of Arq Backups, to support scripting a manual QoS override


A simple Applescript to change transfer speed settings in Arq Backups

Note: specific transfer rate limit should already be set
Note: tested on Arq Backups v5, OSX Mohave 


Arq Backups: https://www.arqbackup.com/ No affiliation with Arq creators... but this is the best cold storage backups app for OSX, IMO.
